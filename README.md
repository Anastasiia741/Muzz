# HomeTaskMuzz 📲
## Key Features:
### Screen with a list of chats. The key points:
- display the latest message
- displayed the date of the last message
- if there is an unread message, then we highlight the user’s line with an indicator (pink circle).
### Chat with a friend:
- sort messages from old to new 
- messages are filtered by date
- we show older messages in the format date "Day" 
- if the message was sent yesterday, then we show format date “Yesterday at time” 
- if today then “Today at time” 
   if several messages were sent, then we group them under one heading “today at time”
### A sample message model has been created with the ability to expand functionality and use external services and frameworks for messaging.
### New messages are saved via Code Data.
